## R Markdown

```{r}
library(reshape2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# read in da
df <- read.csv("output/lsoa_df.csv")%>%
        melt(id.vars = c("code","imd","perc_bme"),
           measure.vars ="run_count", 
           value.name = "value")

ggplot(df,aes(X, Y, fill= Z) + 
  geom_tile()

```

## Including Plots



```{r }

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
